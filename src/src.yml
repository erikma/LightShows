# The `shape` section is the arrangement of the lights in your system - change
# this to match your actual lights.  The example is for a matrix that is 32
# pixels wide and 48 high.
#
# Using `shape` only works if you have a strip, a matrix, or a cube.
# For more complex shapes, you will use the `layout` section

# The `driver` section describes the hardware outputs you are using.
